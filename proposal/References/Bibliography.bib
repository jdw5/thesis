abstract={Convolution forms one of the most essential operations for the FPGA-based hardware accelerator. However, the existing designs often neglect the inherent architecture of FPGA, which puts forward an austere challenge on hardware resource. Even though some previous works have proposed approximate multipliers or convolution acceleration algorithms to deal with this issue, the inevitable accuracy loss and resource occupation easily lead to performance degradation. Toward this, we first propose two kinds of resource-efficient optimized accurate multipliers based on LUTs or carry chains. Then, targeting FPGA-based platforms, a generic multiply–accumulate structure is constructed by directly accumulating the partial products produced by our proposed optimized radix-4 Booth multipliers without intermediate multiplication and addition results. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed multiplier achieves a maximum 51% look-up-table (LUT) reduction compared to the Vivado area-optimized multiplier IP. Furthermore, the convolutional process unit using the proposed structure achieves a 36% LUT reduction compared to existing methods. As case studies, the proposed method is applied to DCT transform, LeNet, and MobileNet-V3 to achieve hardware resource saving without loss of accuracy.},
